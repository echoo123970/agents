## Available agents

### `shopify-product-creator`

Creates new products in the connected Shopify store. It collects the product
details (title, description, price, variants, images, collection), validates
them against the Shopify Admin API's requirements, and creates the product —
defaulting to **DRAFT** status so nothing goes live by accident.

**Requires:** the Shopify MCP server to be connected (it uses the
`mcp__Shopify__*` tools). The server is wired up in [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json);
see [`SHOPIFY_SETUP.md`](SHOPIFY_SETUP.md) for the credentials and network
access you need to provide to make the connection live.

**Use it by asking the main assistant things like:**

- "Add a new product: a navy cotton t-shirt, $29.99, sizes S/M/L"
- "Create a product for my new ceramic mug, $18, with a short description"
- "List a new item in my store and put it in the Summer collection"

The agent definition lives in
[`.claude/agents/shopify-product-creator.md`](.claude/agents/shopify-product-creator.md).
